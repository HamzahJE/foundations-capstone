My project is called Daily App, An app for App for daily use. I intended it be the go to app for me and for my peers. 
Something where you would find daily things you might need like weather, news, motivation, and the cute dog pictures of course.

It can be really hard to stay focused and stay motivated with a fast-paced environment so I wanted to help solve this issue.
